# Small project to re-implement 'legendary' tool created by my master, Tho Nguyen

## Getting start

- Prepare photos inside a designed folder name `photos`
- Use `ruby image_convert.rb show_image_list photos` to make photo

## Testing.
- There is dedicated tool named `rspec` and you can try with `rspec` to perform
  testing.
